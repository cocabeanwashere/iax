This is a hack in progress to download files from IA with resume.  It's far from "correct" at the moment since I'm just hacking to get something to work.

I've downloaded files using ia and many are failing half way through or more wasting transfer bytes when it has to be restarted.

IA seems to be ignoring the requests (letting them timeout after connect) now, while I can still download using ia.exe and the browser.  It was working for a long while.  I'm not sure why they are blocking it, or if they are.  My guess is some heuristic to avoid ddos or some other perceived afrount. If you have an idea, let me know.

If you use this code to modify or improve, consider shooting me a message.  No worries if you don't.
